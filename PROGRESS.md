# Project Progress

## Initial State (2025-10-21)

*   Project structure (workspace, `engine`, `cli` crates) is set up.
*   `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `PLAN.md` provide initial project context and roadmap.
*   `PHASE_ONE.md` details the plan for the MVP.
*   Currently, the project contains placeholder files and basic `Cargo.toml` configurations, awaiting implementation of core features.

## Progress Update (2025-10-21)

*   **Folder Structure:** Validated and created missing `crates/examples` and `assets` directories as per `DESIGN.md`.
*   **Dependency Verification:** Confirmed `crossterm`, `serde`, `toml`, `anyhow`, `clap`, and `shape-engine-core` dependencies are correctly configured in `crates/engine/Cargo.toml` and `crates/cli/Cargo.toml`.
*   **Basic CLI Commands Implemented:**
    *   Refactored `crates/cli/src/main.rs` to use `clap` subcommands: `run` (with `--config` and `--framerate` arguments) and `list-scenes`.
*   **Code Quality:** Resolved compiler warnings related to unused imports and mutable variables.
*   **Test Run:** Successfully executed `cargo run -p shape run --config examples/minimal.toml --framerate 60`. The program ran for 10 frames (0-9) as expected due to the current placeholder loop in `main.rs`.
